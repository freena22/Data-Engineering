# Data Engineer Track @ DATAQUEST

This is for Data Enginner Track Study at Dataquest.ai. Even if entering the role of a data engineer is not my intended outcome, by the end of this path I will learn strategies to deal with petabytes of data, automating intensive queries, and understanding the architecture of a robust data platform. All the tools, algorithms, and design of a data engineer's role will teach me to become an indespensible member of a data team and can even help you with my own data needs.

Generally, a data engineer's responsibility is to build the architecture for a data platform that enables data analysts, scientists, and other curious types to query their data without worry. Essentially, a data engineer needs to have the skills to build a data pipeline that connects all the pieces of the data ecosystem together and keep it up and running.
